# Simulation of central limit theorem
A simulation to understand the central limit theorem on a data set collected from the students  at a particular university and to examine 
how the estimate of true mean change as sample size increases. Data set includes various things including how happy they are and the 
amount of time they study.

## Conclusions
The population mean was 78.03 and the standard deviation was 16.31. The happiness scores were negatively skewed.
Samples of different sizes were drawn from the population to simulate Central Limit Theorem. 
The size of our sample was increased from 5 to 25, the sample means become less variable and tended to cluster more tightly
around the true mean. And the shape of the distribution become more normal as sample size increased. 
So the sample means became better estimators of the true population mean.
